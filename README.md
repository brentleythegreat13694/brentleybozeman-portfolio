##  Brentley Bozeman Portfolio

Hello! This is my programming portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring it. You have two options: either go to my **GitHub** page or run it locally.

##  How to Run the Website Locally (Flask/Python)

1.  Open your **terminal**, file explorer, or command prompt; then **CD** into the folder that contains **main.py**, the **static** folder, and the **templates** folder.
2.  **Critical Structure:** This is very important, or it may not work. Also, make sure you have the Flask Python framework installed in your Python **environment**.
3.  You can either run the script in an **IDE** or execute it directly:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You should see my page!
    * **Note:** Your `index.html` file must be placed inside the **templates** folder, and the **static** folder must contain your `.css` file and your `images` folder. This is very important for the **front-end** to work.
